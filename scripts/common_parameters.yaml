# This file (common_parameters.yaml) includes parameters that can be
# usefully pre-pended to the parameters file provided to job launcher
# $CAMMAC/jobs/job_pm.sh (pre-pending implies that they have lower
# priority)

# This actually happens for calls to job_pm.sh which are done by
# scripts colocated with the present file.

# It contains those parameters which value is usefully shared among
# co-located scripts. Current values are for the actual AR6/WGI
# figure production run
